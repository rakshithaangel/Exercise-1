Design Patterns Demonstration

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns using Java. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate an understanding of different design patterns through practical use cases.

Overview

The code in this repository is divided into two main exercises:

Design Patterns Demonstration

Behavioral Design Patterns

Observer Pattern:It is building a news application that sends notifications to subscribers whenever a new article is published.
Strategy Pattern:It is developing a game where different characters have various attack strategies. The Strategy pattern can be used to encapsulate these attack strategies and make them interchangeable.
Creational Design Patterns

Singleton Pattern: A configuration manager with a single instance.
Builder Pattern: It is a developing a configuration management system for a complex application.
Structural Design Patterns

Adapter Pattern: A media player supporting different formats using an adapter.
composite pattern:It is developing a graphic design application where users can create complex shapes by combining simple shapes (like circles and rectangles) into composite shapes.
Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer (Mini-Project)

A console-based application for managing astronaut daily schedules with CRUD operations, task validation, and conflict notifications.

Evaluation Criteria

Functionality: Correct implementation of design patterns and functionality.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of all errors and edge cases.
Performance: Optimized code.
Explanation: Clear explanation of design decisions and logic.
Documentation: Well-documented code and clear usage instructions
